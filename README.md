# SQL--Challenge

For Week 9 Challenge we were required to perform data modelling,data engineering and data analysis using SQL.

We created a database in Postgresql and designed a schema using QuickDBD tool.Then we imported data into each table from the provided CSV files and finally analysed the data to answer questions about the data by creating sql queries.
